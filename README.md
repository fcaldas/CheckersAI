# CheckersAI

Implementation of a checkers game with basic AI (minimax tree) with variable depth and a nice graphical interface.
The code is written in C++ using SDL for the graphical interface.

To compile just clone the repository and use 'make'

The rules used are slightly different from normal checkers, on this game a queen can move as many houses as it wishes and once you capture a piece you can play again.
